## Upgrade Guide

### From 1.2.0 to 1.3.0

**Breaking Changes:** None

**New Features:**
- Issue Tracking system (advanced/optional)
- 3 new templates for issue management
- CLI tool for automation (issue-manager.sh)

**Migration Steps:**

1. Pull latest changes:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.mcp-servers/devops-practices
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. No configuration changes needed - MCP server automatically serves new practice and templates

3. Issue tracking is **optional** - only use for complex projects:
   - Project has >20 work items
   - Duration >1 month
   - Need detailed tracking beyond TRACKER.md milestones

4. To use issue tracking in a project:
   ```bash
   # Copy templates to your project
   cp ~/.mcp-servers/devops-practices/templates/ISSUES.md ./
   mkdir -p issues
   cp ~/.mcp-servers/devops-practices/templates/issues-README.md ./issues/README.md

   # Optional: Install CLI tool
   cp ~/.mcp-servers/devops-practices/tools/issue-manager.sh ./scripts/
   chmod +x ./scripts/issue-manager.sh
   ```

5. Read the practice:
   ```bash
   cat practices/issue-tracking.md
   # Or ask Claude: "Show me the issue tracking practice"
   ```

**When to use:**
- ✅ Complex projects with many work items
- ✅ Long-duration projects (>1 month)
- ✅ Need complete work history for reports

**When to skip:**
- ❌ Simple projects (<5 tasks)
- ❌ Use TRACKER.md only

**Projects Affected:** None automatically - opt-in only

**Impact:** No impact on existing workflows - this is an additional optional capability
